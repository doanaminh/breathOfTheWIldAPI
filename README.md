## How It's Made

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

An extensive database for items, creatures, weapons, and armor for the world of Hyrule incorporating the BotW API [https://gadhagod.github.io/Hyrule-Compendium-API/#/] created by Aarav Borthakur [https://github.com/gadhagod]. 

An autocomplete search bar allows users to find exact and/or similar matches to their search query.

Alternatively, users can search with the forward or back arrow through individual list sets available through the API by clicking on the icons for the following categories:

* Food Creatures
* Non-food Creatures
* Equipment
* Material
* Monsters
* Treasure

## Lessons Learned

Learned a substantial amount about object manipulation in JavaScript.
